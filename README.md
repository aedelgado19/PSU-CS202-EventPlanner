# PSU-CS202-EventPlanner
For this program assignment, we were tasked to create an event planner to demonstrate
**single inheritance OOP**. For this class hierarchy, I utilized a Time base class,
which is inherited by an Event type (which contains protected information like
an event's street address). Then, three different types of events inherit the Event class.
These three types of events each have unique data and functions.

Other techniques demonstrated in this code are **iterators** and **vectors**, and **dynamic memory allocation**.

Events are stored in either an array of **linear linked lists** or in a **circular linked list**, depending on the assignment's
requirements of each data type.
